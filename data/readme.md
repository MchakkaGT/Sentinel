# Data (Checkpoint Samples)

This folder contains **small samples** used for checkpoint validation runs.
These samples are intentionally small (10–50 rows/items) to keep the repo lightweight.

## Included samples
- ag_news_sample.csv (toy drift input)
- crows_pairs_sample.jsonl (toy bias input)
- truthfulqa_sample.jsonl (toy robustness input)

Each sample mirrors the **shape** of the real dataset format used by the benchmark runner.
